AequilibraE
===========

AequilibraE is the first comprehensive Python package for transportation
modeling, and it aims to provide all the resources not easily available from
other open-source packages in the Python (NumPy, really) ecosystem.

If you are looking for the documentation for AequilibraE for QGIS, you can
see it on its own webpage `aequilibrae for QGIS 3 <http://www.aequilibrae.com/qgis>`__

AequilibraE as a path computation engine
========================================

Given AequilibraE's incredibly fast path computation capabilities, of of its
important use cases is the computation of paths in general transportation
networks and between any two nodes, regardless of their type (centroid or not).

This use case supports the development of a number of computationaly intensive
systems, such as map matching of GPS data, simulation of Demand Responsive
Transport (DRT, e.g. Uber) operators
